# Computer Networks II Assignment - Socket Programming

The assignment is a part of the course "Computer Networks II" in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

The goal of this assignment is to  use Java Libraries in order to communicate with a remote server of our University, using UDP and TCP protocols. During the experiment we received: 
* Echo Packets
* Images
* Audio Files using DPCM
* Audio Files using AQDPCM
* Packets from Ithakicopter
* Packets from an Ithaki Vehicle 

We used [**Wireshark**](wireshark.org) to analyze the packets we send and receive from the Ithaki Server. Screenshots from the program, during the experiment can be found in _wireshark.pdf_.

Details about the packets received during the experiment and a short analysis about the performance can be found at the _session.pdf_ and _session2.pdf_.

The report in Greek about the project is in the _report.pdf_.
